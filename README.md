## About

This is a fork of [hassio-addons/addon-spotify-connect](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-spotify-connect). It adds a few more features, like all of the LibreSpot options and events in Home Assistant.

The Home Assistant Spotify Connect add-on allows you to use your device,
running Home Assistant, to play your Spotify music. This add-on uses the
Spotify Connect protocol, which makes it a device that can be controlled
by all the official clients.

For example; Running Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi with this add-on
installed will allow you to play your Spotify music on the Pi. So all you'll
have to do is hook up your sound system to the Pi and start booming!
